## Sakrae — Invariants

These invariants define what must remain true for Sakrae to retain coherence as an artistic field and listening architecture.  
Any implementation, interface, collaboration, or system that violates these invariants is considered out of scope.

---

### 1. Listening Precedes Explanation
No interpretive, contextual, or explanatory material may appear before first contact with sound.

---

### 2. Sound Is Never Background
Sakrae is not designed for multitasking, mood regulation, or ambient use.  
If sound becomes ignorable, the field has collapsed.

---

### 3. No Optimization Layer
Sakrae is not optimized for engagement, retention, metrics, virality, or growth.  
Any system that requires optimization logic is incompatible.

---

### 4. No Forced Progression
Listeners are never guided, instructed, or moved through steps.  
Sequence may be suggested by structure, never enforced by instruction.

---

### 5. One Threshold at a Time
Any listening container may have only one dominant point of entry.  
All other elements must be recessed, optional, or dormant by default.

---

### 6. Interpretation Follows Sensation
Language may describe what emerges after listening, but may not frame what is about to be heard.

---

### 7. Silence Is Structural
Silence is treated as an active component of the system, not absence.  
Design choices must preserve space, pause, and non-response.

---

### 8. No Identity Performance
Sakrae is not used to signal taste, affiliation, status, or belief.  
Any framing that encourages identity adoption is prohibited.

---

### 9. Lineage Without Hierarchy
Foundational contributors, protocols, and mentorship are acknowledged precisely and without inflation.  
Authority may be named, never leveraged.

---

### 10. No Therapeutic Claims
Sakrae makes no claims of healing, regulation, treatment, or outcome.  
Any benefit is experiential and non-prescriptive.

---

### 11. No Algorithmic Mediation
Autoplay, recommendation engines, ranking systems, and behavioral nudging are prohibited.

---

### 12. Art Is Not Documentation
The work itself is encountered only in its proper container (e.g., sakrae.com).  
Repositories may document conditions, never substitute for encounter.

---

### 13. Volitional Depth Only
All deeper material (lyrics, context, lineage, protocols) must be optional and self-initiated by the listener.

---

### 14. Refusal Is Preserved
The system retains the right to say “no” to expansion, collaboration, or tooling that compromises coherence.

---

### 15. Coherence Over Scale
Any choice between reach and integrity is resolved in favor of integrity.

---

## Enforcement Note

These invariants are not guidelines.  
They are constraints.

If a future decision feels productive but violates an invariant, the invariant prevails.
