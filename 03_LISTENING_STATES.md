## Sakrae — Listening States

This document describes the observable listening states that commonly arise through contact with Sakrae.
These states are not prescribed outcomes, stages, or guarantees.
They are descriptive markers used to understand how attention reorganizes after encounter.

No state is required.
No state is permanent.
No interpretation is implied.

## 1. Pre-Contact Posture

**Description**
The listener arrives with habitual listening patterns shaped by optimization, background sound, and distraction.

**Common Characteristics**
- Music used as accompaniment or mood regulation
- Attention divided across tasks
- Expectation of utility or payoff

**Notes**
This posture is not corrected or addressed.
It is simply the condition of arrival.

## 2. Threshold Contact

**Description**
First deliberate engagement with sound occurs.

**Common Characteristics**
- Heightened awareness of silence before and after tone
- Reduced multitasking
- Subtle bodily stillness or pause

**Notes**
This state is often brief.
No meaning is extracted.

## 3. Destabilization of Background Listening

**Description**
Previously automatic listening habits become uncomfortable or unsatisfying.

**Common Characteristics**
- Reduced tolerance for background music
- Increased sensitivity to sonic clutter
- Desire for either full presence or silence

**Notes**
This is not aversion.
It is recalibration.

## 4. Attention Reorientation

**Description**
Listening becomes an active posture rather than passive intake.

**Common Characteristics**
- Slower perception of time during listening
- Awareness of bodily response before thought
- Decreased need to interpret or narrate experience

**Notes**
This state may generalize beyond music.

## 5. Integration

**Description**
Changes in listening posture persist outside the Sakrae container.

**Common Characteristics**
- Greater discernment between signal and noise
- Reduced engagement with algorithmic sound environments
- Increased comfort with silence

**Notes**
No behavioral directive is implied.
Integration varies by individual context.

## 6. Non-States (Explicitly Not Expected)

The following are not goals or indicators of success:
- Emotional catharsis
- Healing or therapeutic resolution
- Spiritual insight or revelation
- Identity formation or affiliation

Absence of these does not indicate failure.

## Usage Note

This document is intended for:
- Internal calibration
- Post-contact articulation
- Prevention of misframing

It must not be used as promotional copy or outcome promise.

---

## Enforcement Note

If future language implies progression, achievement, or guarantee, it violates the listening architecture.

Listening remains voluntary, contingent, and sufficient in itself.
