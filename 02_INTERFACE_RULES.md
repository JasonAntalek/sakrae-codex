## Sakrae — Interface Rules

This document defines the interface-level rules that govern how Sakrae is encountered in any container (web, spatial, installation, or future mediums).

These rules exist to preserve listening coherence and prevent distortion through interface design.

---

## 1. Entry Hierarchy

### 1.1 Single Dominant Threshold
Each container must present one primary point of entry into sound.

- This is the first track or listening object.
- It is visually dominant.
- It is not framed or explained beforehand.

All other content must defer to this threshold.

---

### 1.2 Secondary Elements Are Recessed
Additional tracks, sections, or materials may exist, but must be:

- Visually smaller
- Spatially lower
- Temporally optional
- Inactive by default

Secondary elements may invite, but must never compete.

---

## 2. Audio Player Rules

### 2.1 No Autoplay
Sound must never begin without explicit listener action.

---

### 2.2 Neutral Controls Only
Audio players must be minimal and neutral.

Prohibited:
- Animated equalizers
- Visual rhythm indicators
- Emotional or thematic skins

The player must not interpret the sound.

---

### 2.3 One Active Player at a Time
Interfaces must prevent multiple tracks from playing simultaneously.

Overlap collapses attention.

---

## 3. Language Placement Rules

### 3.1 No Pre-Listening Framing
Text that explains, interprets, or contextualizes the work must not appear before first sound.

---

### 3.2 Volitional Depth
Lyrics, notes, and descriptions must be:

- Hidden by default
- Accessed by deliberate action (e.g., accordion)
- Non-instructional in tone

The listener chooses depth.

---

### 3.3 Language Follows Sensation
All language is written post-contact.

Text may reflect:
- texture
- posture
- resonance

Text must not promise outcomes or guide experience.

---

## 4. Visual Rules

### 4.1 Visuals Support, Never Lead
Images may establish atmosphere but must not:

- Tell a story
- Explain meaning
- Compete with sound

---

### 4.2 Recession Over Emphasis
Visual intensity must decrease as the listener moves deeper into the page.

The first threshold may carry presence.
Subsequent sections must quiet visually.

---

### 4.3 No Kinetic Distraction
Animations, parallax, scroll-triggered effects, and motion cues are prohibited.

Stillness is structural.

---

## 5. Navigation & Flow

### 5.1 Linear Without Enforcement
Pages may suggest sequence through layout, but may not:

- Lock progression
- Gate access
- Require completion

---

### 5.2 No Outbound Gravity
Primary listening containers must not include outbound links that pull attention away.

Lineage, repositories, or essays may be referenced only in closing sections.

---

## 6. Lineage Acknowledgment

### 6.1 Precise, Non-Interpretive Credit
Lineage acknowledgments must:

- Name contributors accurately
- Avoid explanatory narrative
- Avoid hierarchical framing

Credit is given without instruction on how to feel about it.

---

### 6.2 Lineage Is Not a CTA
Lineage sections must not function as promotional gateways.

They exist to preserve truth, not redirect attention.

---

## 7. Prohibited Interface Patterns

The following patterns are incompatible with Sakrae:

- Metrics display (plays, likes, shares)
- Comments or reactions
- Recommendation engines
- Popups or interruptions
- Email capture before listening

---

## 8. Portability Rule

Any future container (installation, app, spatial environment) must be able to map directly to these rules.

If a medium cannot honor them, it is unsuitable.

---

## Enforcement Note

Interface convenience never overrides listening integrity.

If a design choice improves usability but violates an interface rule, the rule prevails.

---

## Summary (Operational)

- One threshold
- Volitional depth
- Visual recession
- No kinetic distraction
- No outbound gravity

These rules exist to protect listening—not to optimize experience.
