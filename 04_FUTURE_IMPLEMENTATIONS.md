## Sakrae — Future Implementations

This document enumerates implementation domains that may emerge in support of Sakrae.
It does not specify features, timelines, or technologies.
Its purpose is to preserve coherence by naming categories before solutions.

Nothing in this file is mandatory.
Nothing here authorizes execution by default.

---

## 1. Listening Containers

**Scope**
Environments where sound is encountered.

**Examples (Non-Exhaustive)**
- Web-based sanctuary pages
- Spatial or installation-based listening rooms
- Live, facilitated listening sessions
- Minimal mobile or offline containers

**Constraints**
All containers must conform to:
- 01_INVARIANTS.md
- 02_INTERFACE_RULES.md

If a medium cannot honor those constraints, it is unsuitable.

---

## 2. Archival Systems

**Scope**
Preservation and stewardship of the work without public exposure.

**Examples**
- Version-controlled audio masters
- Session notes and provenance records
- Release history and lineage metadata

**Constraints**
Archives are not encounter spaces.
They are private, protected, and non-interactive.

---

## 3. Translation Layers

**Scope**
Post-contact articulation that follows listening without replacing it.

**Examples**
- Essays and reflections
- Diagrams or schematics
- Interviews conducted after sustained contact

**Constraints**
Translation must follow sensation.
No translation may function as a prerequisite to listening.

---

## 4. Integrity Checks

**Scope**
Mechanisms for detecting coherence loss.

**Examples**
- Interface audits
- Language drift reviews
- Collaboration suitability checks

**Constraints**
Integrity checks prevent expansion by default.
They do not justify it.

---

## 5. Tooling (Deferred)

**Scope**
Software or technical systems that may support the above domains.

**Examples**
- Static site generators
- Audio delivery systems
- Internal review tools

**Constraints**
Tooling is always subordinate to architecture.
If a tool introduces optimization pressure, it is disallowed.

---

## 6. Explicit Non-Implementations

The following are intentionally excluded:
- Recommendation engines
- Social interaction layers
- Engagement tracking or analytics
- AI-generated substitutes for encounter

Exclusion is a form of protection.

---

## Closing Note

This document exists to slow implementation, not accelerate it.

If a future proposal cannot clearly map to one of these domains
without violating existing invariants or interface rules,
it should not proceed.
