+## Sakrae — Recursive Gates
+
+This document defines how change is evaluated before entering Sakrae canon.
+It binds Codex and human custodians equally.
+
+---
+
+## 1. Review Triggers
+
+Changes must enter review when they:
+
+- Alter invariants, interface rules, listening states, or future implementations.
+- Modify lineage, custodianship, or encounter descriptions.
+- Introduce new processes, tools, or integrations touching listening architecture.
+- Adjust enforcement language or operational summaries.
+- Reframe scope, permissions, or thresholds for participation.
+
+Routine corrections of spelling or formatting that do not alter meaning may proceed without formal review but must still respect this document.
+
+---
+
+## 2. Immediate Disqualifiers
+
+A change is rejected without further process if it:
+
+- Optimizes for growth, reach, engagement, virality, or performance metrics.
+- Introduces algorithmic mediation, recommendation, ranking, or autoplay.
+- Frames Sakrae as therapy, self-help, productivity aid, or wellness product.
+- Adds persuasive marketing tone, calls to action, or social proof.
+- Reduces silence, withdrawal, or refusal as active structural elements.
+- Forces progression, gates listening, or makes identity performance central.
+
+---
+
+## 3. Human Witness Requirements
+
+The following require explicit human witness approval before acceptance:
+
+- Any reinterpretation of invariants or interface rules.
+- Revisions that change how listeners are positioned at entry or depth.
+- Adjustments to lineage acknowledgment or custodial authority.
+- Introduction of new review, veto, or escalation protocols.
+- Any change that could alter how refusal or silence is preserved.
+
+Human witnesses must confirm alignment with Phase One constraints and absence of optimization logic.
+
+---
+
+## 4. Slow-Evolving Elements
+
+Elements that may evolve gradually through iterative review:
+
+- Language that clarifies procedures without shifting intent.
+- Descriptions of tooling that support listening without mediating it.
+- Documentation of observed practice patterns within Phase One scope.
+- Refinements to enforcement notes that increase precision, not pressure.
+
+Each evolution must record the reasoning path and retain reversibility.
+
+---
+
+## 5. Prohibitions on Optimization
+
+Sakrae must never be optimized for growth, reach, retention, or performance efficiency.
+No review may introduce metrics-driven goals, growth funnels, or performance tradeoffs that risk listening integrity.
+If a proposed change promises scale at the expense of coherence, it is refused.
+
+---
+
+## 6. Canon Entry Protocol
+
+- All reviewed changes must cite which sections they touch and why.
+- Disqualifiers are checked first; if any apply, the change stops.
+- Human witness approval is logged for all items in Section 3.
+- Slow-evolving elements require documented rationale and rollback points.
+- Acceptance is recorded only when no optimization pressure is present.
+
+Canonical status may be withdrawn if later review finds hidden optimization, speculative framing beyond Phase One, or erosion of refusal and silence.
